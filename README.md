1. Open androidrestapi with VS Code
2. Open terminal and type "npm install"
3. After dependencies are installed type "npm run dev" in terminal
4. Server is now running on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000) (If using this as API endpoint in android app, use your local wifi ip address instead of "localhost")
5. If you want to test the server application without installing the android app, you can use Insomnia or Postman
